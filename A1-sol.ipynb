    "To write a relational algebra (RA) query in a cell, we have already converted the cells under each question into the [Markdown cell](https://jupyter-notebook.readthedocs.io/en/stable/examples/Notebook/Working%20With%20Markdown%20Cells.html). Then, you will need to type RA queries in the cell using the syntax in [radb](https://users.cs.duke.edu/~junyang/radb/index.html). Below is an example of an RA query in the radb format. Please refer to [the radb cheatsheet](https://users.cs.duke.edu/~junyang/radb/cheat.html) for the full list of syntax of RA queries. Please use the radb's syntax to ensure we can run your RA queries. \n",

We will also provide an online tool for you to debug your RA queries (stay tuned for the instructions). It will be much easier to grade if we can run your query and also easier for you to debug with query results. The use of the tool is optional, and submissions to the online tool will not be graded (we only grade the Canvas submission).\n"
